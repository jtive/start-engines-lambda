## Common Error Messages

### No Running Tasks

```
Checking auth tasks...
  Cluster: authapi-cluster
  ‚è≥ No running tasks yet. Waiting...
  ‚è≥ No running tasks yet. Waiting...
  [... continues for 5 minutes ...]
  ‚ùå Task did not reach RUNNING state within 300 seconds
```

**Cause:** No tasks are running in the cluster  
**Solution:** Run `.\start-all-services.ps1` first, or check if tasks failed to start

### Task Stopped

```
Checking pdf tasks...
  Cluster: pdfcreator-cluster
  ‚è≥ Task status: PROVISIONING. Waiting...
  ‚è≥ Task status: PENDING. Waiting...
  ‚ùå Task STOPPED: Essential container in task exited
```

**Cause:** Task crashed or failed health checks  
**Solution:** Check CloudWatch logs for the task, fix the issue, restart the task

### Registration Failed

```
Registering fa with target group...
  IP: 10.0.1.125:2531
  Target Group: unified-fa-tg
  ‚ùå Failed to register: TargetGroupNotFound
```

**Cause:** Target group ARN is incorrect or doesn't exist  
**Solution:** Verify target group ARN in the script configuration

### Target Stays Unhealthy

```

Phase 3: Verify Target Health
========================================

Waiting up to 120 seconds for targets to become healthy...

  ‚è≥ auth is initial
  ‚è≥ auth is initial
  [... continues ...]
  ‚è≥ auth is initial
  ‚ùå auth is unhealthy: Target.FailedHealthChecks
```

**Cause:** Application isn't responding to health checks correctly  
**Solution:**
1. Check target group health check configuration
2. Verify application is listening on correct port
3. Check security groups allow ALB to reach task
4. Review application logs
