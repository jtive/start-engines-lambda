# Target Group Race Condition Fix - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the solution to the race condition bug in `start-all-services.ps1` related to target group registration.

---

## The Problem

### Issue Identified

The `start-all-services.ps1` script invokes a Lambda function that:

1. ‚úÖ Starts ECS Fargate tasks
2. ‚úÖ Waits for tasks to reach RUNNING state  
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediately registers tasks with target groups**
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No verification that registration succeeded**

**Race Conditions:**

- Multiple services starting concurrently can cause timing issues
- Network interface IP assignment may be delayed
- Lambda timeout constraints limit verification time
- PowerShell script doesn't verify Lambda success before moving to next service
- Target group health checks begin before application is ready

**Real-World Impact:**

- Tasks may be RUNNING but not yet healthy
- Target groups may have wrong IPs registered
- Services appear started but aren't receiving traffic
- Manual intervention required to fix target group state

---

## The Solution

### New Script: `verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1`

A comprehensive PowerShell script that safely verifies ECS tasks are running and correctly updates target groups.

**Key Features:**

‚úÖ **Verification-First Approach**
- Actively polls ECS until tasks are confirmed RUNNING
- Extracts actual private IP addresses from running tasks
- Validates task state before any target group operations

‚úÖ **Safe Target Group Updates**
- Only updates target groups after tasks are verified running
- Checks if targets are already registered
- Skips registration if targets are already healthy
- Idempotent - safe to run multiple times

‚úÖ **Health Check Verification** (Optional)
- Waits for targets to become healthy
- Reports health check status in real-time
- Configurable timeout for health checks
- Can skip health check waiting with `-SkipHealthCheck` flag

‚úÖ **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Detailed error messages for each failure type
- Graceful handling of missing or stopped tasks
- Clear status reporting for each service
- Summary with success/failure counts

‚úÖ **Production-Ready**
- Confirmation prompts (bypass with `-Force`)
- Customizable timeouts for different environments
- Colored output for easy visual parsing
- Detailed logging of all operations

## How to Use

### Option 1: Production Deployment (Recommended)

**When to use:** Production deployments, CI/CD pipelines, maximum reliability

```powershell
# Step 1: Start all services
.\start-all-services.ps1 -Force

# Step 2: Wait for tasks to stabilize
Start-Sleep -Seconds 60

# Step 3: Verify and update target groups
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -Force

# Step 4: Check final status
.\check-status.ps1
```

**Why this works:**
- Lambda handles initial task creation
- Wait time allows tasks to reach RUNNING state
- Verification script ensures everything is correct
- Final check confirms all services are healthy

### Option 2: Fix Existing Issues

**When to use:** Tasks are running but target groups are wrong

```powershell
# Just run the verification script
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -Force
```

**Why this works:**
- Script finds currently running tasks
- Updates target groups with correct IPs
- Skips already-healthy targets
- Idempotent - safe to run anytime

### Option 3: Development Quick Start

**When to use:** Development environment, speed is priority

```powershell
# Start services
.\start-all-services.ps1 -Force

# Quick verification (skip health check wait)
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -SkipHealthCheck -Force
```

**Why this works:**
- Faster than waiting for health checks
- Still verifies tasks are RUNNING
- Still updates target groups correctly
- Health checks will complete in background

### Option 4: Individual Service Recovery

**When to use:** One service is problematic

```powershell
# Start the service
.\start-single-service.ps1 -Service pdf

# Verify just that service
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -Services pdf -Force
```

**Why this works:**
- Focused on single service
- Faster than checking all services
- Doesn't affect other running services

## Technical Details

### Phase 1: Verify Tasks are RUNNING

```
1. List tasks in cluster with RUNNING desired status
2. Describe task details to get actual state
3. Check lastStatus field (PROVISIONING ‚Üí PENDING ‚Üí RUNNING)
4. Extract private IP from network interface attachment
5. Repeat until RUNNING or timeout (default: 5 minutes)
```

**Handled States:**
- `PROVISIONING` ‚Üí Wait
- `PENDING` ‚Üí Wait  
- `ACTIVATING` ‚Üí Wait
- `RUNNING` + IP available ‚Üí Success
- `STOPPED` ‚Üí Report error and skip
- Timeout ‚Üí Report timeout error

### Phase 2: Register with Target Groups

```
1. Check if target already registered in target group
2. If healthy, skip registration (already correct)
3. If not registered or unhealthy, register target
4. Use extracted IP and configured port
5. Handle registration errors gracefully
```

**Features:**
- Checks existing registrations first
- Prevents duplicate registrations
- Uses correct port per service
- Detailed error messages

### Phase 3: Verify Target Health (Optional)

```
1. Poll target health every 10 seconds
2. Report current state for each target
3. Exit early if all become healthy
4. Timeout after configured duration (default: 2 minutes)
5. Report final health status
```

**Target States:**
- `initial` ‚Üí Waiting for first health check
- `healthy` ‚Üí Passing health checks (goal)
- `unhealthy` ‚Üí Failing health checks (investigate)
- `draining` ‚Üí Being deregistered (wait)
- Other states ‚Üí Report as warnings

## Configuration

### Service Configurations

The script includes service configurations that match `config.py`:

```powershell
$serviceConfigs = @{
    "auth"  = @{ cluster = "authapi-cluster"; targetGroupArn = "..."; port = 8080 }
    "pdf"   = @{ cluster = "pdfcreator-cluster"; targetGroupArn = "..."; port = 9080 }
    "fa"    = @{ cluster = "fa-engine-cluster"; targetGroupArn = "..."; port = 2531 }

    "batch" = @{ cluster = "batch-engine"; targetGroupArn = "..."; port = 8080 }
}
```

**Important:** Keep this in sync with your actual AWS resources!

        }
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Reports "TIMEOUT"

**Cause:** Task didn't reach RUNNING state within timeout

**Solutions:**
1. Increase timeout: `-MaxWaitSeconds 600`
2. Check ECS task logs for startup issues
3. Verify task definition is correct
4. Check if cluster has capacity

### Target Shows "unhealthy"

**Cause:** Application not responding to health checks

**Solutions:**
1. Check target group health check configuration
2. Verify application is listening on correct port
3. Check security groups allow ALB ‚Üí Task traffic
4. Review application logs for errors
5. Test endpoint directly: `curl http://<task-ip>:<port>/health`

### "Target already registered" Warning

**This is normal and good!** The script detected existing registration and will verify it's correct.

If target is already healthy, script skips registration (optimal behavior).

### Tasks Won't Start

**This is an ECS issue, not a script issue.**

**Solutions:**
1. Check ECS console for task failures
2. Review CloudWatch logs for task
3. Verify task definition is valid
4. Check IAM roles and permissions
5. Ensure container images are accessible

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use in Production

```powershell
# Production deployment pattern
.\start-all-services.ps1 -Environment prod -Force
Start-Sleep -Seconds 90
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -Environment prod -Force -MaxWaitSeconds 600
.\check-status.ps1 -Environment prod
```

### 2. Use Appropriate Timeouts

- **Development:** Default timeouts (fast feedback)
- **Production:** Longer timeouts (reliability)

```powershell
# Production with longer timeouts
.\verify-and-update-target-groups.ps1 -MaxWaitSeconds 600 -HealthCheckWaitSeconds 300
```

### 3. Monitor Output

- Don't ignore yellow warnings
- Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- Verify final health status

### 4. Keep Configuration Synchronized

- Update PowerShell configs when AWS resources change
- Verify target group ARNs are correct
- Ensure cluster names match

### 5. Document Your Process

- Add to deployment runbooks
- Train team on both scripts
- Keep this guide accessible
